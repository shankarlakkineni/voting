		<h1>Democracy Is the Best Form of Government</h1>
		<p >Benefits of Voting:
Voting is a basic process that keeps a nation’s governmental system works. It enables the citizens to choose their own government. It also allows the people to choose their representatives in the government. The purpose of every government is to develop and implement various policies for the benefit of its citizens.

It also enables the person with the right to question the government about issues and clarifications. Voting is the way to express the opinion of a citizen in a democratic nation. Voting is crucial to activating the democratic process.

On the day of the election, voters won’t just have the capacity to choose their representatives in government for the following term, and they can also decide on measures like security issues that concede the government authority to borrow funds for development projects and different advancements. Also, in some cases, voters cast their voting sheets on social issues.

Right to vote:
Right to vote energizes social awareness since it empowers political cooperation. The citizens can follow the progress of the political representatives and the legislature. This consistent process enables the general population to settle on educated choices about whom to vote in favor of in the following term. Also, the legislature can’t generally act arbitrarily when the entire nation is observing.

Every adult is given the right to vote, irrespective of sex, class, occupation and so forth. This is representative of uniformity and congruity. It is a fundamental right in which all citizens get an opportunity to choose who represents them.

Every party that is competing in any elections announces and establishes various benefits and social reforms for their people. Some of these political parties might be deceiving with their initial reforms, but can have the intention of corruption. It’s the responsibility and skills of citizen that decides which government is elected.

It is the right, benefit and obligation to vote as a citizen of your nation and an individual from your society. Individuals may figure their vote does not make a difference, but rather votes can shape remote monetary and social arrangements.

		Election Commission
The Election Commission of India is an autonomous entity prescribed in the Constitution of India. It is the federal authority responsible for administering all the electoral processes of India and ensuring they are free and fair.[16]

Elections are conducted according to constitutional provisions and parliamentary legislation. These include the Representation of the People Act, 1950, which mainly deals with the preparation and revision of electoral rolls, and the Representation of the People Act, 1957 which deals, in detail, with all aspects of the conduct of elections and post-election disputes. The Supreme Court of India has held that where the enacted laws are silent or make insufficient provision to deal with a given situation in the conduct of elections, the Election Commission has the residuary powers under the Constitution to act in an appropriate manner.

From 1947 to 16 October 1989, there was one Chief Election Commissioner. From 1989 to 1 January 1990, there were two commissioners. In 1990 of January, two chief commissioners were abolished and election commission acted as a single-member body. Again by The Election Commissioner Amendment Act, 1993 made the Election Commission a multi-member body. On 1 October 1993, a further two commissioners were appointed. Decisions are made by majority vote.
